# pEngine [![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/bugimw9j2fenx90r?svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/AndreaDemontis/pengine) [![CodeFactor](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/pizzakun/pengine/badge)](https://www.codefactor.io/repository/github/pizzakun/pengine)

pEngine is a 2D **game engine** developed in C# using OpenGL.
This engine is for general purposes, if you want a new **custom feature** for this engine please make a request in the Issues page.

## Plans

I wish to constantly improve the engine, ther's **no ETA** for any build of this project, being a student I do not always have time to devote to development on this.

## Requirements

- A desktop platform (windows or OSX) with **.NET 4.6** or **Mono** installed and Visualstudio or Visualstudio for MAC.
- Remember to download **submodules** (use `--recursive` parameter in git clone).
